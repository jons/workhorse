this source code viewer was constructed with as-of-yet-unnamed, underdeveloped MVC framework (codename workhorse) for PHP in eight minutes.

each class is an extension of the Application class, which contains all of the input and output systems.

there is a Command class which is created from user input with a small pattern matching system and then executed
according to the methods of a subclass of Application.

there are also view pages which create an application object and then run it immediately, however, any amount of
processing could have been done first, even with other application objects.

for a robust example, read the source of the tao class (tao.class.php) and view page (tao.php).
