a man is born gentle and weak.<br><br>at his death he is hard and stiff.<br><br>green plants are tender and filled with sap.<br><br>at their death they are withered and dry.<br><br><br><br>therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.<br><br>the gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.<br><br><br><br>thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.<br><br>a tree that is unbending is easily broken.<br><br><br><br>the hard and strong will fall.<br><br>the soft and weak will overcome.
