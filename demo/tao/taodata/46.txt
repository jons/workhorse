when the tao is present in the universe,<br><br>the horses haul manure.<br><br>when the tao is absent from the universe,<br><br>war horses are bred outside the city.<br><br><br><br>there is no greater sin than desire,<br><br>no greater curse than discontent,<br><br>no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself.<br><br>therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.
