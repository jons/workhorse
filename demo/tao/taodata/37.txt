tao abides in non-action,<br><br>yet nothing is left undone.<br><br>if kings and lords observed this,<br><br>the ten thousand things would develop naturally.<br><br>if they still desired to act,<br><br>they would return to the simplicity of formless substance.<br><br>without for there is no desire.<br><br>without desire there is.<br><br>and in this way all things would be at peace.
