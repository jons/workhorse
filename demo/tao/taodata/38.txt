a truly good man is not aware of his goodness,<br><br>and is therefore good.<br><br>a foolish man tries to be good,<br><br>and is therefore not good.<br><br><br><br>a truly good man does nothing,<br><br>yet leaves nothing undone.<br><br>a foolish man is always doing,<br><br>yet much remains to be done.<br><br><br><br>when a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone.<br><br>when a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done.<br><br>when a disciplinarian does something and no one responds,<br><br>he rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order.<br><br><br><br>therefore when tao is lost, there is goodness.<br><br>when goodness is lost, there is kindness.<br><br>when kindness is lost, there is justice.<br><br>when justice is lost, there ritual.<br><br>now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion.<br><br>knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of tao.<br><br>it is the beginning of folly.<br><br><br><br>therefore the truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface,<br><br>on the fruit and not the flower.<br><br>therefore accept the one and reject the other.
