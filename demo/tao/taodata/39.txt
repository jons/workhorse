these things from ancient times arise from one:<br><br>the sky is whole and clear.<br><br>the earth is whole and firm.<br><br>the spirit is whole and strong.<br><br>the valley is whole and full.<br><br>the ten thousand things are whole and alive.<br><br>kings and lords are whole, and the country is upright.<br><br>all these are in virtue of wholeness.<br><br><br><br>the clarity of the sky prevents its falling.<br><br>the firmness of the earth prevents its splitting.<br><br>the strength of the spirit prevents its being used up.<br><br>the fullness of the valley prevents its running dry.<br><br>the growth of the ten thousand things prevents their drying out.<br><br>the leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall of the country.<br><br><br><br>therefore the humble is the root of the noble.<br><br>the low is the foundation of the high.<br><br>princes and lords consider themselves "orphaned", "widowed" and "worthless".<br><br>do they not depend on being humble?<br><br><br><br>too much success is not an advantage.<br><br>do not tinkle like jade<br><br>or clatter like stone chimes.
