under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.<br><br>all can know good as good only because there is evil.<br><br><br><br>therefore having and not having arise together.<br><br>difficult and easy complement each other.<br><br>long and short contrast each other:<br><br>high and low rest upon each other;<br><br>voice and sound harmonize each other;<br><br>front and back follow one another.<br><br><br><br>therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking.<br><br>the ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,<br><br>creating, yet not.<br><br>working, yet not taking credit.<br><br>work is done, then forgotten.<br><br>therefore it lasts forever.
