there is a saying among soldiers:<br><br>  i dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest;<br><br>  i dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot.<br><br><br><br>this is called marching without appearing to move,<br><br>rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm,<br><br>capturing the enemy without attacking,<br><br>being armed without weapons.<br><br><br><br>there is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy.<br><br>by underestimating the enemy, i almost lost what i value.<br><br><br><br>therefore when the battle is joined,<br><br>the underdog will win.
