everyone under heaven says that my tao is great and beyond compare.<br><br>because it is great, it seems different.<br><br>if it were not different, it would have vanished long ago.<br><br><br><br>i have three treasures which i hold and keep.<br><br>the first is mercy; the second is economy;<br><br>the third is daring not to be ahead of others.<br><br>from mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;<br><br>from humility comes leadership.<br><br><br><br>nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;<br><br>they abandon economy, but try to be generous;<br><br>they do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.<br><br>this is certain death.<br><br><br><br>mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.<br><br>it is the means by which heaven saves and guards.
