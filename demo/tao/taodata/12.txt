the five colors blind the eye.<br><br>the five tones deafen the ear.<br><br>the five flavors dull the taste.<br><br>racing and hunting madden the mind.<br><br>precious things lead one astray.<br><br><br><br>therefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees.<br><br>he lets go of that and chooses this.
