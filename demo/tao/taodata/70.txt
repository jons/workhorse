my words are easy to understand and easy to perform,<br><br>yet no man under heaven knows them or practices them.<br><br><br><br>my words have ancient beginnings.<br><br>my actions are disciplined.<br><br>because men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.<br><br><br><br>those that know me are few;<br><br>those that abuse me are honored.<br><br>therefore the sage wears rough clothing and holds the jewel in his heart.
