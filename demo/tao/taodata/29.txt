do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?<br><br>i do not believe it can be done.<br><br><br><br>the universe is sacred.<br><br>you cannot improve it.<br><br>if you try to change it, you will ruin it.<br><br>if you try to hold it, you will lose it.<br><br><br><br>so sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;<br><br>sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;<br><br>sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;<br><br>sometimes one is up and sometimes down.<br><br><br><br>therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.
