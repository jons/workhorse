a great country is like low land.<br><br>it is the meeting ground of the universe,<br><br>the mother of the universe.<br><br><br><br>the female overcomes the male with stillness,<br><br>lying low in stillness.<br><br><br><br>therefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country,<br><br>it will conquer the smaller country.<br><br>and if a small country submits to a great country,<br><br>it can conquer the great country.<br><br>therefore those who would conquer must yield,<br><br>and those who conquer do so because they yield.<br><br><br><br>a great nation needs more people;<br><br>a small country needs to serve.<br><br>each gets what it wants.<br><br>it is fitting for a great nation to yield.
