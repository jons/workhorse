a small country has fewer people.<br><br>though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.<br><br>the people take death seriously and do not travel far.<br><br>though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them.<br><br>though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.<br><br>men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.<br><br>their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;<br><br>they are happy in their ways.<br><br>though they live within sight of their neighbors,<br><br>and crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,<br><br>yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.
