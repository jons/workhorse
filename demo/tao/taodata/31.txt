good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them.<br><br>therefore followers of tao never use them.<br><br>the wise man prefers the left.<br><br>the man of war prefers the right.<br><br><br><br>weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools.<br><br>he uses them only when he has no choice.<br><br>peace and quiet are dear to his heart,<br><br>and victory no cause for rejoicing.<br><br>if you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing;<br><br>if you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.<br><br><br><br>on happy occasions precedence is given to the left,<br><br>on sad occasions to the right.<br><br>in the army the general stands on the left,<br><br>the commander-in-chief on the right.<br><br>this means that war is conducted like a funeral.<br><br>when many people are being killed,<br><br>they should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow.<br><br>that is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.
