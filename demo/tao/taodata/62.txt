tao is source of the ten thousand things.<br><br>it is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad.<br><br>sweet words can buy honor;<br><br>good deeds can gain respect.<br><br>if a man is bad, do not abandon him.<br><br>therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,<br><br>or the three officers of state installed,<br><br>do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses,<br><br>but remain still and offer the tao.<br><br>why does everyone like the tao so much at first?<br><br>isn't it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin?<br><br>therefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.
